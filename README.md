# Usage

Due to the nature of Knex migrations, there isn't a great way to add them to a project.  Knex doesn't support multiple migration paths.

It would probably be best to copy the migrations from this repo into your project.

The `/src/migration_helpers.js` containers helps for using the triggers in table migrations
